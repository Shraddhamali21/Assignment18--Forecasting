1. COCA-COLA SALES DATASET

In this data science project, I tackled the task of forecasting CocaCola prices and airline passenger data using various forecasting models. Leveraging statistical techniques and time series analysis, I aimed to develop accurate and reliable models for predicting future prices and passenger counts. The datasets used for this analysis are named "CocaCola_Sales_Rawdata.xlsx" and "Airlines+Data.xlsx," containing historical data on CocaCola prices and airline passenger counts, respectively. Here's an overview of the project:
 
Problem Statement:
 
The primary objective of the project is to develop forecasting models for predicting CocaCola prices and airline passenger counts. By analyzing historical trends and patterns in the data, the goal is to build models capable of accurately predicting future prices and passenger counts. These forecasting models can provide valuable insights for business planning, inventory management, and resource allocation.
 
Approach:
 
The project follows a structured approach to model development and analysis, encompassing the following key steps:
 
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
 - Exploring the datasets to understand the distribution and characteristics of the CocaCola prices and airline passenger counts.
 - Preprocessing the data by handling missing values, transforming variables, and splitting the datasets into training and testing sets.
 
2. Forecasting Models:
 - Implementing various forecasting models, including but not limited to:
 - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
 - Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
 - Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL)
 - Prophet
 - Creating dummy variables for any categorical variables present in the datasets, if applicable.
 
3. Model Evaluation:
 - Evaluating the performance of each forecasting model using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess accuracy.
 - Comparing the RMSE values of different models to determine the most suitable model for each dataset.
 
4. Documentation and Selection:
 - Preparing a document for each forecasting model, explaining the methodology, assumptions, and parameters used.
 - Calculating the RMSE value for each model and documenting the results.
 - Selecting the most appropriate forecasting model based on the RMSE values and other relevant evaluation criteria.
 
By leveraging Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and statsmodels, the project aims to provide reliable and accurate forecasting models for predicting CocaCola prices and airline passenger counts. The project not only enhances my skills in time series forecasting but also demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques in business decision-making and planning.
